# Shanghai-pm2.5

Shanghai is a global financial center and transport hub which is located on China's east coast. The air pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but still substantial by world standards. PM2.5 has a great influence on human?s health and is one of the major sources of air pollution. Therefore, the study of PM2.5 is of great significance. 

The study mainly focuses on three questions: 

i) What are the relevant factors for PM2.5? How are they affecting PM2.5? 

ii) Is PM2.5 getting better or worse in the past several years? 

iii) Is there any suggestions to improve air quality?
